# IMAGE-BASED-FOOD-CLASSIFICATION-AND-CALORIE-ESTIMATION
This project uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to estimate the calorie content of different fruits and vegetables from images. It includes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to classify various food items, combined with image segmentation to estimate food volume and calculate calories .
